A collection of data visualisation projects that I have enjoyed doing recently. These include contributions to the [#TidyTuesday challenge](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) along with other data visualisation projects that I was interested in. All visualisations were done using 100% R-code, mostly using `{ggplot2}`, `{tidyr}` and `{dplyr}` but also other amazing packages in the R and tidyverse ecosystem.

### 3. Exploring the Central Limit Theorem

This is a ShinyApp used to explore the Central Limit Theorem. I recently wrapped some R-code that I used as a teaching tool during some of the biostatistics courses that I taught into a ShinyApp.
